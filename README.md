# Rocket Simulation Project

This portfolio contains engineering projects related to propulsion, rocket staging, and orbital mechanics.

## ðŸš€ Rocket Simulation (Python)
- Models a two-stage launch system with thrust, air drag, and apogee detection
- Calculates orbital velocity and orbital parameters
- Future goals: simulate eccentricity, periapsis, and inclination
  
## Tools Used
- Python, MATLAB (in progress)
- SolidWorks, Onshape
- GitHub, Bambu Studio
