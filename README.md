# Jet Engine Design & Rocket Simulation Projects

This portfolio contains engineering projects related to propulsion, rocket staging, and SolidWorks design.

## ðŸš€ Rocket Simulation (Python)
- Models a two-stage launch system with thrust, air drag, and apogee detection
- Calculates orbital velocity and orbital parameters
- Future goals: simulate eccentricity, periapsis, and inclination

## ðŸ’¡ Jet Engine Design (SolidWorks + 3D Printing)
- Custom CAD of a multi-stage axial jet engine for FDM printing
- Designed for Bambu A1 printer with correct tolerances
- Includes: Inlet, compressor, combustion, turbine, nozzle
  
## Tools Used
- Python, MATLAB (in progress)
- SolidWorks, Onshape
- GitHub, Bambu Studio
